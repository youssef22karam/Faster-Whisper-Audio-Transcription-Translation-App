## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/youssef22karam/Faster-Whisper-Audio-Transcription-Translation-App.git
   cd audio-transcription-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**

## Configuration

### Language Settings

The app can be easily configured for different languages by modifying the settings at the top of `Whisper ui.py`:

```python
# Whisper transcription language (ISO 639-1 codes)
WHISPER_LANGUAGE = "es"  # Change to your desired language

# Translation settings
TRANSLATION_SOURCE_LANG = "es"  # Should match WHISPER_LANGUAGE
TRANSLATION_TARGET_1 = "en"     # First translation (English)
TRANSLATION_TARGET_2 = "ar"     # Second translation (Arabic)

# UI display names
TRANSLATION_TARGET_1_NAME = "English Translation"
TRANSLATION_TARGET_2_NAME = "Arabic Translation"
```

### Supported Languages

**Transcription (Whisper):** Supports 99+ languages including:
- English (`en`), Spanish (`es`), French (`fr`), German (`de`)
- Italian (`it`), Portuguese (`pt`), Russian (`ru`), Japanese (`ja`)
- Korean (`ko`), Chinese (`zh`), Arabic (`ar`), Hindi (`hi`)
- Dutch (`nl`), Swedish (`sv`), and many more

**Translation:** Supports all major world languages via Google Translate API

### Model Configuration

```python
MODEL_SIZE = "medium"    # Options: tiny, base, small, medium, large, large-v2, large-v3
DEVICE = "cpu"          # Options: cpu, cuda (if GPU available)
COMPUTE_TYPE = "int8"   # Options: int8, float16, float32
```

## File Structure

```

## API Endpoints

- `GET /` - Main application interface
- `POST /upload` - Upload audio file for transcription
- `POST /translate` - Translate text to configured languages

## Usage Tips

1. **First Run:** The app will download the Whisper model on first use (may take a few minutes)
2. **HTTPS Required:** Modern browsers require HTTPS for microphone access
3. **Mobile Optimization:** The interface is designed primarily for mobile use
4. **Network Translation:** Requires internet connection for translation features
5. **Audio Quality:** Clear audio recordings produce better transcription results

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Microphone not working:**
- Ensure you're accessing via HTTPS
- Grant microphone permissions in browser
- Check browser compatibility (Chrome/Firefox recommended)

**Model download fails:**
- Check internet connection
- Ensure sufficient disk space
- Try a smaller model size (`tiny` or `base`)

**Translation not working:**
- Verify internet connection
- Check if Google Translate is accessible in your region

### Performance Optimization

- Use `cpu` device for better compatibility
- Choose smaller models (`tiny`, `base`) for faster processing
- Use `int8` compute type for memory efficiency

## Hardware Requirements

- **Minimum:** 4GB RAM, 2GB free disk space
- **Recommended:** 8GB RAM, 4GB free disk space
- **GPU:** Optional (CUDA-compatible for faster processing)

## Browser Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 14+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+
